## The mission
A client of yours asks for a meeting.
"I know some programming yourself, you know", he proudly tells you.
You know a lot of "great" stories start with a sentence like this and indeed...
The next you know, you get a bunch of spaghetti code to work with.

Luckily, you remember Koen introduced you to the MVC pattern. Sounds like this can help for the structure!
Time to roll up your sleeves ðŸ’ª For those scratching their head at the moment: yes, you may use previous exercises.

## Must-have features

Transform this index into a well-structured MVC application. (without using any frameworks)
Make sure you retain all functionality.
Weather you start from scratch or adapt the given code if your choice to make.

> Building a project structure from scratch will greatly benefit you when making use of frameworks like Symfony or Laravel

## Nice to haves
* Is there still logic in the view? Does it make sense to move it to the controller, a model or another spot?
* The starting package is pretty bare bones. Give it's styling a much-needed upgrade.
* What if a user hits an article detail page without a result? Throw an error with the relevant (and well known) error code.
* Have the data come from a database.
* Based your structure solely on a previous project? Feel free to experiment once you've got the basics right!

Best of luck!
I hope you'll be able to end with these famous words:
